This application or code allows the submission of a ticket into zoho desk through a contact form with PHP.

The ability to do this was due to using two tutorials or sources. They include the following: 

- Zoho CRM How to create records with API V2 using cURL & PHP
	> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToCP_MwORAw

- PHP Code To Insert Ticket Automatically
	> https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/topic/php-code-to-insert-ticket-automatically-22-4-2021

Check the demonstration of this on YouTube

I felt the need to make this because I found the process of doing this so tedious. It took me days of reading, reaching out to customer support and testing to make this work. I wished something like what I've finally stiched togther was available from the get go to make things easier.I hope this helps you 🙂.
